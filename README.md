# SlotMachineRandomization

##Project Description
Project involves creating a hypothetical system for generating random arrangements for a slot machine used in Gambling. 

There will be 3 columns each with the characters A, B and C.

For this project, there will be 3 rows : i,ii and iiiwhereby,

When a player bets on a specific row, say i, There has to be a uniform match of I character spreading across the entire row ...so for example we can have BBB(Each column has the value B, and thus a uniform row) - player wins.

We can have different sets where a player chooses to either bet on Uniformity of just I row, or bet on 2 or even all 3 rows hoping for a match on atleast 1 row.

The more the number of sets, the higher the bet amount.
